# React Food Order App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

One of a series of personal projects I am building to master ReactJS.
This project manages a cart state using React Context and passes the state to different components of the project to render a fully functional and dynamic simple e-commerce UI.
